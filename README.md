"SNaiL"
* Slow down the spread of AI using our creations without consent. 

Mission Statement:

The widespread use of AI has become a significant security and privacy concern that is often overlooked.
Generative AI consumes numerous forms of media and content for its training, most of which has never been approved for training. 
AI should be used to facilitate and streamline creativity, without the worry of privacy breaches and unethical uses.
SNaiL seeks to help protect your text files from being detectable by AI models.
While not foolproof, it is enough to take a stand for increased AI laws and regulations.
SNaiL slows down the processing of your PDFs and redirects models away from your data and information.
